## Estimated Hours 

# I spent around 5 hours on revising through the lecture notes as well as completely the practical task.

## Content Insights 

#  Recognising the unique nature of this subject, I took the initiative to self-educate during my own time, relying on personal resources. The LinkedIn Learning courses proved particularly helpful in guiding me through the practical aspects of the task.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

# Upon finishing the practical task and utilising the LinkedIn service, I was pleasantly surprised to discover the array of courses and useful resources the platform offers. I hadn't initially realized that LinkedIn provided such courses, and now I have a valuable resource to refer to whenever I need it in the future. I've come to terms with the fact that it won't be handed to me easily; instead, I recognise the need to grasp concepts independently.
