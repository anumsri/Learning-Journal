# Week 5
# learning Activities and Resources
In week 5 I learnt how child themes work and how they are related to parent themes. I watched LinkedIn learning resources to understand how to create a child theme as well as learnt how to migrate a site to a local host using a program called Local by flywheel. I watched LinkedIn videos but also watched some youtube videos to grant a better understanding of how child themes work and how to set them up. Additionally I read over the assignment and began to think about creating my group.

# Estimate Hours
I spent 1 hour on this weeks practical, and 2 hours on learning the material. 

# Content Insights
This week was mainly focused on child themes and how they can be utilised with parant themes. I realised how imporatnt they were as it allows me to modify existing themes without alterning the original themes files. The preservation of the parent themes functionality enable safer updates and development. They also served as a testing area for new features and designs without the risk of losing modifications during theme updates. I believe that child themes will be a must for when i would like to develop websites. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Although I understand how Child themes work, I began to enjoy Wordpress more due to its ease of use. However in my earlier subjects with web development where HTML and CSS were used I did not enjoy those as much. Considering that CSS is the main function of child themes, im not too sure if this is an area i am looking to pursue in my future career. Additionally setting up my LinkedIn profile this week, I learnt how important it is to expand my profile to improve my chances of getting a job after graduation.
