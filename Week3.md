## Week 3

## Learning Activities and Resources

# This week, I delved deeper into WordPress, watching LinkedIn tutorials on advanced WordPress techniques and learning about online hosting. I gained a better understanding of how to create a basic website using WordPress and how to host it on a live service, specifically LightSail. Additionally, I explored the setup of local development environments for WordPress and learned about the differences from live hosting. Lastly, I conducted further research on how child themes work. I previewed the practical last week and encountered some difficulties, so I attended a seminar to gain a better understanding of the expectations.

## Content Insights 

# This week I learnt how important Wordpress is as it offers  a user-friendly interface, making website creation and management accessible for me regardless of my expertise. I have noticed how valueable learning and understanding the different aspects of it are, as well as how important is was for me to undersatnd how child themes work. Im starting to feel much more confident after this week, as I completely understand how to utilise wordpress for my assignment so I can start thinking about how I am going to complete it.   

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

# Gaining a foundational understanding of WordPress and familiarised myself with the underlying mechanics of its website development, I became more interested in this specific area of learning. I initially didnt enjoy the development of Static HTML websites using HTML and CSS however using a Content managment system like Wordpress has been much more enjoyable experience for me and I would like to study it further.
