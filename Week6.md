# Week 6
# learning Activities and Resources
In week 6 I learnt What daily standup meetings are and how they are utilised to help teamwork. I also spent most of the weeks learning time, reading through the assignment doc and understanding what is expected for the assignment. The assignment instructed the group to learning how Trello boards work as well as Integrating Github with both Slack and Discord. This proved to be difficult so I had to watch youtueb videos on how these can be integrated together.

# Content Insights
This week I mainly learnt how useful stand up meetings are for group work, which in this case is with my assignment. Perusing through the assignment requirements I understand that it is fairly large with numerous expectations, and that I will need to attend as many group meetings as I can in order to meet those expectations. I will have to do my own research In order to achieve a better understanding of the different programs that will be utilised to create the website

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I understand now how standing up meetings can be utilsed in my future career when working with a team. The benefits of improved team coordination as well as an increase in the groups transperancy, progress and risk awareness, It would seem that in most jobs that I would work in where teamwork is a factor, Standup meetings would be an important concept to be aware about.
