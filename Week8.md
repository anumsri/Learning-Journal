## Learning Experiment
## Hypothesis:
I hypothesise that employing spaced repetition techniques will enhance my retention of PHP syntax and concepts in contrast to previous weeks when I primarily relied on passive learning approaches.

## Testing 
1. Study Plan: 
Develop a weekly study schedule that involves dedicating 30 minutes each day to reviewing PHP syntax and concepts.
2. Spaced Repitition:
Use a spaced repetition tool like quizlet to create flashcards for PHP concepts.
3. Daily Review: 
Review flashcards for at least 10 minutes a day
4. Quiz: 
At the end of the week, test knowledge and understanding from a quiz on PHP concept to test retention.
5. Comparison:
Compare the results of the quiz to previous weeks' performance on similar quizzes.

## Results
After implementing the spaced repetition technique for learning PHP syntax and concepts, I found that my retention and recall of the material had significantly improved compared to previous weeks. The daily review of flashcards helped reinforce my understanding of the concepts, making it easier to recall them during the quiz. The spaced repetition technique proved to be an effective method for improving my learning efficiency and retention of PHP.

# Learning Insights 
Compared to previous weeks where passive learning methods were employed, the active engagement with the material through spaced repetition led to significantly improved retention and recall during the quiz. This experiment has highlighted the importance of actively engaging with the material and incorporating spaced repetition into my learning routine to enhance learning outcomes.
