# Week 7
# learning Activities and Resources
In week 7, I delved into the fundamentals of PHP, gaining a solid understanding of its syntax and basic concepts. To achieve this, I primarily relied on LinkedIn Learning resources, which provided comprehensive tutorials on PHP basics. These resources helped me grasp key concepts such as variables, data types, operators, and control structures. Additionally, I supplemented my learning by reading online documentation and articles to reinforce my understanding. Furthermore, I engaged in hands-on practice by writing simple PHP scripts to reinforce my understanding of the language. This combination of theory and practice was crucial in solidifying my understanding of PHP's foundational concepts.
